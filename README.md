* The large CSV files in data/ are stored with Git LFS

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Update the data with `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`.. this is a bit slow and will take a few minutes
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
